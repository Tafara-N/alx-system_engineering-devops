# About Bash projects

Unless stated, all your projects will be auto-corrected with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

### Concepts

*For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:*

- [Struggling with the sandbox? Try this: Using Docker & WSL on your local host](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/100039)

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

## General

- What are the characteristics of hidden files and how to list them
- What does the command `cd -` do

## Looking Around

# Requirements

## General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line ([why?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the `chmod` command: `chmod u+x file`. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.

# More Info

*Example of line count and first line*

```bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ wc -l 12-file_type
2 12-file_type
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ head -n 1 12-file_type
#!/bin/bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$
```

In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: `chmod u+x file`. We will see later what does `chmod` mean and do, but you can have a look at `man chmod` if you are curious.

*Example*

```bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
12-file_type
lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -la lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ cat lll
#!/bin/bash
ls
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ chmod u+x lll # you do not have to understand this yet
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rwxrw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ./lll
12-file_type
lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$
```
