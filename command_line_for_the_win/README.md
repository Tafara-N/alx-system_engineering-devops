# Background Context

[CMD CHALLENGE](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/a83_NOBEtXgFr1Yqej0HYA) is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your command line skills!

# Requirements

## General
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- This project will be manually reviewed.
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels
- Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format

## Specific
In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required `screenshots` to `GitHub`, you are also required to demonstrate the use of the `SFTP` (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

- [SFTP File Transfer Tutorial](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/aTKBzKWZ5EI-qZjJVblUzg)

## Here are the steps to follow:
- Take the `screenshots` of the completed levels as mentioned in the `general` requirements.
- Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
- Use the `SFTP command-line tool` to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the `hostname`, `username`, and `password` provided to you for the sandbox environment.
- Once connected, navigate to the `directory` where you want to upload the `screenshots`.
- Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the `screenshots` from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
- Confirm that the `screenshots` have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
- Once the `screenshots` are transferred, you can proceed to push the `screenshots` to `GitHub` as mentioned in the initial requirements.
- Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.

## NOTE:
- The screenshoots of completed level should be inside the dir `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/`
